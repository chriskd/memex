# Docs: align MCP setup + AI integration with actual CLI

kb/guides/mcp-setup.md lists tools/commands that don’t exist, and kb/guides/ai-integration.md references mx context init (not implemented).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MCP tool list reflects actual server/tooling (or removes unsupported tools)\n- [ ] AI integration guide removes mx context init; documents manual .kbcontext creation or actual command\n- [ ] Examples validated against current CLI
