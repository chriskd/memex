# MX 0.2.0 readiness review

Do a release‑readiness sweep for MX 0.2.0 across UX, core flows, and docs. Validate the primary user journeys end‑to‑end (init, add/update, search, typed relations, publish), confirm behavior is consistent across CLI + frontmatter + publisher output, and capture any functional gaps or rough edges. Run a performance sanity check for indexing/search/publish on a representative KB size and note regressions or optimization opportunities. Ensure documentation is accurate and complete in both `README.md` and the project KB.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core user journeys verified end‑to‑end with a short runbook recorded
- [ ] Typed relations behave consistently across CLI, storage/frontmatter, and publisher output (create/edit/remove/render)
- [ ] Performance sanity check completed (indexing, search, publish) with findings addressed or tracked
- [ ] Usability issues triaged; high/medium issues fixed or ticketed
- [ ] `README.md` updated with 0.2.0 usage guidance and examples
- [ ] Project KB docs updated to match current behavior
- [ ] State diagrams added for all major flows
