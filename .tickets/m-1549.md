# Fix mx init README frontmatter + invalid --local suggestion

mx init creates kb/README.md without frontmatter, causing reindex warnings on first add. It also prints a '--local' flag suggestion that isn't supported by the CLI. Both are confusing for new projects.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] kb/README.md created by mx init has valid frontmatter or is excluded from indexing\n- [ ] mx init next-steps output no longer references --local; uses --scope or removes the flag\n- [ ] Add/adjust tests to cover init output and reindex warning


## Notes

**2026-01-25T18:51:23Z**

Added frontmatter to init README (user+project), replaced --local with --scope in init README and next steps, added init test parsing README; ran uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py::TestInitCommand::test_init_creates_kb
