# Docs: update CLI reference + relations graph docs

kb/reference/cli.md and kb/memex/relations-graph docs are out of sync with current CLI. Missing commands/flags (relations, relations-add/remove, templates, quick-add, ingest, include-neighbors), and includes unsupported flags (mx add --template).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLI reference includes current commands and flags, removes unsupported ones\n- [ ] Relations graph docs mention mx relations + relations-add/remove with correct behavior/flags\n- [ ] Examples match current CLI help
