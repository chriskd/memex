# Fix scoped typed-relations handling (indexing/publish/neighbor expansion)

Typed relations have edge-case issues with scoped paths: update_entry_relations reindexes using unscoped relative paths (stale results in multi-KB), publisher drops @project/@user in relation targets, and neighbor expansion doesn't normalize .md/scope like relations_graph.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] update_entry_relations reindexes/deletes with scope-aware paths (adds regression test)\n- [ ] Publisher preserves or explicitly handles scoped relation targets in URLs/output\n- [ ] Neighbor expansion normalizes relation paths consistently with relations_graph (add tests)
