# Cold start: consistent 'No KB configured' errors

Cold-start UX: commands like mx list/tree/whats-new/get should not silently act like an empty KB when no KB exists. Show the standard ConfigurationError guidance (mx init / mx init --user / MEMEX_USER_KB_ROOT) and exit non-zero.

## Acceptance Criteria

- mx list/tree/whats-new/get/relations in a directory with no KB show the same friendly 'No knowledge base found' guidance\n- No Python tracebacks in this path\n- Exit codes are non-zero for these commands when KB missing\n- Add tests


## Notes

**2026-02-08T02:40:05Z**

Implemented fail-fast KB config checks for cold-start commands (list/tree/whats-new/relations) via cli helper _require_kb_configured; commands now show ConfigurationError guidance and exit non-zero instead of behaving like empty KB. Updated/added CLI tests. Files: src/memex/cli.py, tests/test_cli.py.
