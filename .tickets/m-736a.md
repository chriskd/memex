# mx get: handle ConfigurationError (no 'Get failed')

mx get currently prints fallback 'Get failed.' when ConfigurationError occurs, and --title path can emit traceback. Catch ConfigurationError and route through _handle_error without generic fallback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- mx get without a KB prints the standard 'No knowledge base found' guidance\n- mx get --title without a KB does not print a traceback\n- Tests


## Notes

**2026-02-08T02:40:10Z**

Verified mx get ConfigurationError path is handled without generic 'Get failed.' fallback; added tests for get by path and get --title when no KB configured (no traceback, shows guidance). Files: tests/test_cli.py.
