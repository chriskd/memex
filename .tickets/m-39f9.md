# Add relations CLI helpers

Provide convenience commands/flags to add/remove typed relations without rewriting full frontmatter (e.g., mx relations add/remove or mx patch --relations).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CLI can add a typed relation to an entry\n- [ ] CLI can remove a typed relation from an entry\n- [ ] Updates preserve existing frontmatter and ordering\n- [ ] Tests cover add/remove workflows


## Notes

**2026-01-24T22:30:14Z**

Added relations add/remove helpers in CLI backed by new core update_entry_relations, plus CLI tests and docs updates.
