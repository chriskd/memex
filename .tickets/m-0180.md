# Integrate typed relations into search neighbors

Extend mx search --include-neighbors to traverse typed relations (relations graph) in addition to semantic links/wikilinks, with clear labeling in output and JSON.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search neighbor expansion can include relations graph edges\n- [ ] Output marks relation-based neighbors and relation type\n- [ ] JSON output includes relation metadata\n- [ ] Tests cover mixed wikilink/relations traversal


## Notes

**2026-01-24T22:30:09Z**

Integrated typed relations into neighbor expansion in core, updated search neighbors tests and docs, and adjusted CLI help text to mention typed relations.
