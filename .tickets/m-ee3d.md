# MX session memory vNext roadmap

Coordinate the pivot away from full A-Mem parity toward session-resume memory. Define what to keep vs drop from A-Mem work, align dense memory signals, and ensure a purpose-built eval harness exists. This epic should link related epics/tickets and keep the roadmap coherent if context is lost.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Roadmap KB entry exists with keep/drop rubric and guiding principles\n- [ ] A-Mem component audit completed with keep/drop list\n- [ ] Session-resume eval epic linked and tracked\n- [ ] Dense signals epic linked and tracked\n- [ ] Cleanup/archival tasks filed for LoCoMo/A-Mem parity assets
